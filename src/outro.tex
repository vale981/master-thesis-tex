\chapter{Conclusion and Outlook}
\label{cha:concl-ideas-future}

In this work, we set out to find a way of accessing bath related
observables, such as the expected bath energy change and the
interaction energy expectation value, using the
NMQSD\footnote{Non-Markovian Quantum State
  Diffusion}/HOPS\footnote{Hierarchy of Pure States} framework which
we introduced in \cref{chap:intro}.  This endeavor was indeed
successful as was laid out in \cref{chap:flow}.

In \cref{chap:flow} we presented a solution to a well known model for
quantum Brownian motion. Using this solution, we were able to derive
expressions for the bath energy change \(∂_{t}\ev{H_{\bath}}\).

This enabled us to verify the results of \cref{chap:flow} in
\cref{chap:numres} by solving the same model numerically using
HOPS. Excellent agreement was found in
\cref{sec:hopsvsanalyt}.

Turning to the spin-boson model in \cref{sec:prec_sim}, we used energy
conservation to verify again, that we can consistently and efficiently
compute bath related observables with HOPS. In the cases where the
consistency condition was not met, we nevertheless found that
qualitatively correct results had been reached. The direct calculation
of the interaction energy by the use of \cref{sec:intener} gives
results that are more precise than the ones obtained through energy
conservation.

We continued to explore the energy transfer behavior of the zero
temperature spin-boson model and found that energy transfer
performance for strong coupling has a complicated dependence on the
spectral density of the bath. Energy transfer performance can be
optimized longer bath memories and resonant baths when the interaction
is turned off at the right time.

The short time dynamics of the bath energy change can be explained by
neglecting the system Hamiltonian, which we verified for the
spin-boson model. It was also found, that this short time behaviour is
already present on the trajectory level so that there are no
stochastic fluctuations for short times. During this initial period,
the auxiliary states of the HOPS are being populated.

In \cref{sec:singlemod} we turned to issues of quantum
thermodynamics. We reviewed some general analytical results that
bounded energy extraction from open systems in
\cref{sec:basic_thermo}, both for the single-bath and the multi-bath
case. We then turned to some more challenging applications of the HOPS
method. First, a driven spin-boson model was considered. We found that
a not insignificant fraction of the theoretical maximum of energy can
be extracted by modulating the coupling and providing a bath with long
memory time. We also demonstrated quantum friction, a quantum speed
limit and a bath resonance phenomenon.

Finally, we treated a model with multiple baths in \cref{sec:otto} and
non-harmonic smooth modulation. A cyclic modulation protocol was
implemented upon a two level system coupled to two baths in a
spin-boson like fashion. We achieved finite power with finite
efficiency and verified a Gibbs-like inequality
\cref{sec:operational_thermo}. When disabling the coupling modulation,
the power and efficiency were much reduced.

A worthwhile task for future work would be to verify the results
summarized in \refcite{Binder2018} for the Otto cycle. Especially the
optimization for optimal power which leads to the
Novikov–Curzon–Ahlborn efficiency \(η_{ca}=1-\sqrt{T_{c}/T_{h}}\) is
interesting in the case of stronger coupling.

Another cycle to study would be a Carnot-type cycle, where the
modulation of the system and the thermalization with the bath occur at
the same time. Interpolating between Otto and Carnot, as well as
studying the effect of overlapping and shifting strokes is a
fascinating avenue for future exploration.

Also, more interesting working media, such as a three level system are
of interest. In \refcite{Uzdin2015Sep} it is shown, that in certain
regimes quantum coherence can lead to superior power output. In the
same regime different types heat engines are equivalent. Both these
effects have been observed experimentally in \refcite{Klatzow2019Mar}. It
would be interesting to see if the slight deviations from theory in
\cite{Klatzow2019Mar} could be explained using HOPS.

The so called Anti-Zeno Effect occurring in systems under fast
modulation has recently received some attention
\cite{Mukherjee2020Jan,Xu2022Mar}. An advantage is claimed to exist,
due to the broadening of the resonance criterion which we have
observed in
\cref{sec:one_bath_cutoff,sec:modcoup_reso,sec:otto}. Being a
consequence of the energy time uncertainty it is being argued, that
the origin of this advantage is truly quantum. The tools for the
exploitation of this effect and its verification are provided in this
work. However, a strong coupling analysis has already been performed
using HEOM in \refcite{Xu2022Mar}.

In \refcite{Santos2021Jun} a cycle is proposed that first creates states
of finite ergotropy by letting energy flow through the working medium
and then extracting this ergotropy in a separate stroke. This work
could be verified and expanded to the non-Markovian regime.

A useful improvement of the method would be the ability to snapshot
the total state of system and bath and then propagate this state with
different modulation protocols. Also, exploring the thermofield method
for finite temperature to avoid the slow convergence of the flow may
be worthwhile. However, at least for coupling that is not hermitian,
this would only trade computational effort for memory, as the number
of hierarchy states would increase.

Finally, in the spirit of~\cite{Esposito2015Dec} one could employ the
HOPS to verify whether a given definition of internal energy that
includes the interaction energy is path independent.
