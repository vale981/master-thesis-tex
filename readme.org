* Valentin Boettcher's Masters Thesis
This is the $\LaTeX$ source of my master's thesis.
Download the latest version of the ~pdf~ [[https://github.com/vale981/master-thesis-tex/releases/download/latest/index.pdf][here]].

The main code of the project can be found [[https://github.com/vale981/master-thesis][in a separate repo]].h
Results and graphics will be synchronized from there.

** Building
Because of ~Microtype~ it is recommended that you use *LuaLaTeX*.  A
basic ~TeXLive~ install along with the packages listed in ~flake.nix~
should suffice to build the thesis.

You can either invoke ~latexmv~ (the ~pdf~ will be in the ~output~
folder) or ~nix build~ if you're on nix.
