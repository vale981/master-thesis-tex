These are the planning and notes for the talk for "Wissenschaftliches
Arbeiten".

There is a total time of 20 minutes to fill, which is going to be
a pretty tough upper bound.

* Introduction
** DONE General Model                                               :WAITING:
:PROPERTIES:
:DURATION: 2
:END:

- hamiltonian multiple baths
- (def. BCFs)

** DONE Motivation
:PROPERTIES:
:DURATION: 2
:END:
- weak coupling/equilibrium well settled
- strong coupling: no consensus (lots of citations)
- won't be settled in a masters thesis but ->
  - access to bath/interaction observables with exact dynamics would
    be helpful
- this where hopsflow will come in
- also: nice maintainable tooling would be good

** DONE NMQSD
:PROPERTIES:
:DURATION: 2
:END:

- nmqsd equation
- not much more

** DONE HOPS
:PROPERTIES:
:DURATION: 2
:END:
- hops for multiple baths
- with new normalization

* Bath Energy
** DONE Formulas and Generalizations
:PROPERTIES:
:DURATION: 2
:END:
- short derivation
- explain hurdles
- explain nonzero

** DONE Interaction Energy
:PROPERTIES:
:DURATION: 1
:END:
- straight forward -> remove dot

* Analytical Verification
** Model
:PROPERTIES:
:DURATION: 2
:END:

- for one HO
- give valentin credit
** Solution
:PROPERTIES:
:DURATION: 5
:END:

- give valentin credit
- general idea
- formula for laplace transform of exponential
- trick with mathematica
** Comparison
:PROPERTIES:
:DURATION: 2
:END:

- one bath case for zero and nonzero temperature
** Quick review of the two HO case
:PROPERTIES:
:DURATION: 3
:END:

- explain that generalization is straight forward
- problems with numerics (sensitive to bcf)
- show comparison

* Applications
** One Bath, Zero
- quick mention of use as convergence check, no details
  - it is hard to get "perfect" convergence, but qualitative picture
    is ok pretty fast
- quick mention of resonance effect -> already present in weak coupling
- non show that non markovianity has to be exploited pretty rigorously
- point out initial slip, mention that this has to do with initial pure dephasing
- dependence of the energy change on shape of bcf -> beyond weak
  coupling and non-markovianity
** One Bath with Modulation
- take the figure from the poster
- explain ergotropy bound
- show relevance of non-markovianity
** Show a picture of a circular process
- just as demo, not looked into this
** show plots of anti zeno engine
- say wip
- explain anti zeno engine
- hard to reproduce -> weak coupling but very high temperatures
- ideally hops allows us to go beyond the restrictive setting in the
  paper

* HOPS Related, No Details
:PROPERTIES:
:DURATION: 3
:END:

- code and docs and tests and poetry
- auto norm
- new cutoff
- tree hops

* Outlook
:PROPERTIES:
:DURATION: 3
:END:

- concrete models
  - sweep
  - three baths
- steady state detection -> pseudo eigenstates?
- higher order moments of bath energy
  - may bring insight into role of aux states
  - better cutoff for multi bath (not as many cross terms)
- concrete importance sampling
